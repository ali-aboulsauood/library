# Library

A small web browser-based library app, created as a practice with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) (TOP) on [Objects and Object Constructors in JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-objects-and-object-constructors).

This is my [eighth practice project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) with The Odin Project.
I would appreciate it if you also take a look at [my other projects](#other-projects), including [my other projects with TOP](#other-projects-with-the-odin-project).

## Viewing the project

You can view the project through its [GitHub Pages website](https://ali-aboulsauood.github.io/library).

### Before you view the project

- This project is best viewed in **a maximized [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) browser window on a `1920 x 1080` monitor**. It is not guaranteed that other browsers, window sizes or resolutions will produce the intended, or even fairly acceptable, visual results. Also, **_this project is NOT designed for mobile browsers_**.

- **Your custom library will NOT be saved** and will be lost on reloading (refreshing) the page or on closing the page tab or the web browser and loading the page again, though I intend to [implement this feature in the future](#upcoming-features).

If you notice any bugs or issues in the project, feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/library/issues/new).

And finally, **If you like my project, please support me by starring it on GitHub and liking it on the project's [community solutions page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library/project_submissions).**

## Features

Currently, the project has the following features:

1. **Add Book**: You can add a new book the button labeled "_Add Book_", which can be found on the right side of the header, on the top-right side of the _Library_ section, and additionally in the library section if the library is empty. Currently, you can set the following attributes foe each book: title, author name, genre, number of pages (optional), description (optional), and whether you have finished reading the book.

2. **Delete Book**: You can delete a book from the library by clicking on the trash can icon located at the bottom-right corner of its book card.

3. **Mark as Read/Unread**: You can mark a book as read or unread (i.e. that you have or have not finished reading the said book) through a toggle labeled "_Mark as read_" or "_Mark as unread_" on its book card.

4. **Library Log**: Contains a table with related statistics to the library. Currently, it shows the total number of books, total number of book pages, number and percentage of books that you have and have not finished reading. The log is updated as you add/edit/delete books or mark them as read/unread. You can hover over table headers to view a tooltip explaining the statistic it represents.

### Upcoming features

The project is intended to have the following features in the (hopefully near) future:

1. **Storage**: The most likely course is that the project will use local storage first, then it will later have a backend where it could be possible to store your library on the cloud by signing in with an account, or to store it locally if you choose not to sign in.

2. **Edit Book**: Self-explanatory: you will be able to edit the details of an already created book.

3. **Color Themes**: Light, Dark, and Sepia themes.

**NOTE**: Since this is a practice project, any pull requests implementing any of the aforementioned features will be rejected. If you wish to contribute, try only to resolve any [issues](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/library/issues) or make improvements to the project (explaining your rationale in th pull request).
